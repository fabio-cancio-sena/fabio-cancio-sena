## Summary
Hey there! I'm Fábio Sena, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at NuBank, passionate about tackling intriguing machine learning problems. With seven years of experience, I've explored the lesstraveled paths, collaborating with tech industry leaders to deliver innovative and game-changing solutions.

My expertise lies in weaving together machine learning, cloud computing, algorithms, and data structures to build highly efficient
and scalable models. At Appen, I successfully deployed nearly 30 models in production, while also contributing to the design and migration of ML cloud architecture, enhancing scalability and efficiency. Additionally, I possess expertise in computer vision and natural language processing.

During my time at behup, I designed a robust cloud data architecture utilizing Spark and Elasticsearch. This enabled efficient management, processing, and searchability of millions of data points, providing valuable data-driven insights. Leveraging classical machine learning and NLP techniques, I extracted valuable information from textual data, facilitating decision-making.

My background in software architecture enables me to envision the bigger picture and build robust, scalable systems. By fitting ML solutions seamlessly into broader tech frameworks, I ensure smooth and efficient outcomes.

Apart from my practical experience, I hold an MBA in Data Science and Big Data, enhancing my planning, cloud computing,
communication, and advanced data analytics skills. My capstone project on CV Object Detection showcased cutting-edge computer
vision techniques.

As an advocate of lifelong learning, I stay updated with the latest advancements in the field. Fluent in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, I thrive in collaborating with multicultural teams to deliver impressive results.

Creating scalable and reliable machine learning models that make a real difference fuels my passion. If you have a project or an idea you'd like to discuss, I'm eager to listen. Let's connect and leave our mark in the world of machine learning together!
