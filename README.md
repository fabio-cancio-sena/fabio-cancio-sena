## Summary
As an experienced Machine Learning Engineer, I have a proven track record of delivering scalable and highly available ML models in production using cloud architecture and advanced techniques. My strong background in classical ML, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP combined with my proficiency in Python, AWS Cloud, and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Detectron2, and HuggingFace Transformers have led to successful project delivery in image deduplication, batch inference, transfer learning, audio/speech processing, predictive modeling, recommender systems, and end-to-end NLP pipelines. I hold an MBA in Big Data and Data Science and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, speak fluent English and Portuguese, and am always seeking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I am excited to bring my skills and experience to make a positive impact as a Machine Learning Engineer in a leading organization.
