> # **Projects**
> - Message-Based ML Architecture: Implemented a scalable and trainable message-based ML architecture using AWS SageMaker, Kafka, AWS EventBridge, SNS, SQS, and Batch Transformer.
> - Computer Vision: Developed cutting-edge computer vision models for image deduplication, including face detection and blurring, license plate detection and blurring, transcribing text from images, car object detection from LiDAR data, label bounding boxes in street scene images, and more.
> - Audio/Speech: Designed and implemented models for audio segmentation and speaker diarization.
> - Business Analytics: Used advanced business analytics to create predictive models through survey design.
> - Natural Language Processing: 
>   - Built a product to automatically understand consumer opinions from audio using speech-to-text and a combination of NLP techniques.
>   - Built a natural language processing pipeline to extract valuable information from legal case files in PDF format. Loaded the extracted text into a MongoDB NoSQL database for efficient storage and retrieval. Generated document vectors for each file to enable effective clustering and organization. Grouped related files into hierarchical clusters, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the judge's work.
> - Recommender System: Designed a customer-centric recommender system using cluster analysis and the R library RecommenderLab.
> - Credit Default Risk Prediction: Built an end-to-end pipeline using XGBoost to predict credit default risk.
